# justask
justask is more or less something like [Formspring](http://formspring.me) or [Ask.fm](http://ask.fm), except it's single-user only.  
Think of it as viewing an user on one of these platforms

I, @nilsding, have stopped working on justask already about 8 months ago (July 2013).  I'm currently focusing on the development of justask's successor, justask2.

So, if you want to extend justask, feel free to fork this repo and make pull requests.  Patches welcome.

## Requirements
As always, a web server (any should work) with PHP5 and MySQL installed. I recommend using the latest version of everything.

Oh, and IIS is horrible. Don't try this at home.

## Installation
Before you ask "hurrrr wher is z config.php", I would recommend you to take a look at the install.php. It will generate a
`config.php` for you and even does all the SQL stuff (creating tables and so on…). After finished installing, be sure to
delete the `install.php` and edit your login data using the `ucp.php`. The default user name is "user" and the default
password is "password".

## Upgrading
Upgrading is easy! In most cases, just running the curent `update_jak.php` will work.

## SSL for the User Control Panel (ucp.php) using Apache's .htaccess
First you need to make a new vhost with ssl. Then do symlinks in to your webserver's ssl directory.

Example:
```bash
	# Directory to https
	cd /var/ssl/ask.meikodis.org
	# Symlinks from http to https
	ln -s /var/www/ask.meikodis.org/* .
```

Then do two .htaccess files. One for http to https.

```bash
cat /var/www/ask.meikodis.org/.htaccess
```
```apache
	RewriteEngine On

	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ucp.php [NC]
	RewriteRule .* https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [L]
```


One for https to http.

```bash
cat /var/ssl/ask.meikodis.org/.htaccess
```
```apache
	RewriteEngine On

	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} index.php [NC]
	RewriteRule .* http://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [L]
```
